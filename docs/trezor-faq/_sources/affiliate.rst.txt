How to link correctly?
----------------------

**1. Use a link to TREZOR Shop with your personal referral code after the "?a=":**
`https://shop.trezor.io?a=referralcode <https://shop.trezor.io?a=referralcode>`_

ALTERNATIVELY:

If you only use one source of traffic, for example, your blog, you can `ask us <mailto:support@trezor.io>`_ to replace the referral code by your domain. In that case, your referral code can be skipped and you can link to https://shop.trezor.io directly. We will record all traffic and shopping coming from your domain.

**2. Simultaneously, you can use your email address as a referral code.**

1. The buyer will then either write your email address into the "**Promocode**" field in the Shopping Cart
2. or you can embed it into your referral link like this: `https://shop.trezor.io?a=your_email_address <https://shop.trezor.io?a=your_email_address>`_


Where can I find a logo of TREZOR?
----------------------------------

I see some rewards but I didn't receive any BTC yet. Why?
---------------------------------------------------------

Your reward has to reach the Payout Threshold in order to be processed.
Current Payout Threshold is 0.1 BTC.

Also, the rewards are waiting for at least 35 days to get `Confirmed <https://shop.trezor.io/user/profile/affiliate/#what-are-confirmed-rewards>`_.

After your rewards turn to Confirmed and reach the payout threshold, we manually verify and send your reward to your Payout address.


How do you calculate my rewards?
--------------------------------

We calculate your rewards as a percentage from the final sales price in BTC at the moment of the purchase. Your current percentage is shown in the Summary on this page as *Commissions (%)*.

On rare occasions, you might see a negative Reward in your Transaction history. This happens when a client returns the order and requests a refund.


What are Confirmed rewards?
---------------------------

Confirmed Rewards are Rewards for non-cancelled and non-refunded Orders older than 35 days.
We are waiting for 35 days because the clients have a no questions asked return right that can be applied during 15 days after receiving their order. The delivery usually takes between 2 days to 2 or 3 weeks.


What are Total pending or Unconfirmed Rewards?
----------------------------------------------

**Unconfirmed Rewards** are Rewards for Orders waiting for 35 days to reach their maturity and turn to Confirmed Rewards. After turning Confirmed, they can be sent to your Payout address.

**Total Pending Rewards** is a sum of Confirmed and Unconfirmed Rewards that accumulate on Affiliate's Account waiting for your payout date.
